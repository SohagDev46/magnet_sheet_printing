  faqs: [
    { q: "What's the difference between standard and heavy-duty magnet sheets?", a: "Our standard sheets are perfect for indoor use like fridge magnets or promotional items. The 'Heavy Duty Vinyl' option is thicker and has a stronger magnetic pull, specifically designed for vehicles. It's weather-proof, UV-resistant, and safe for car paint." },
    { q: "Can you print any custom shape I want?", a: "Yes! Our 'Custom Die-cut' option allows for precise cutting to any shape. Simply provide your artwork with a clear vector cutline on a separate layer. This is perfect for making your brand logo or design truly stand out." },
    { q: "What are the artwork requirements for the best print quality?", a: "For optimal results, please provide your artwork in CMYK color mode with a minimum resolution of 300 DPI. We accept PDF, AI, and PSD files. Using our downloadable template is highly recommended to ensure correct sizing and bleed." },
    { q: "How long will it take to receive my order?", a: "Standard production time is typically 2-4 business days after your artwork has been approved. Shipping time within Malaysia varies based on your location and the courier service selected." },
    { q: "Are the car magnets safe for my vehicle's paint?", a: "Absolutely. Our heavy-duty vehicle magnets are designed to be safe for factory paint jobs. To ensure safety, we recommend regularly removing and cleaning both the magnet and the vehicle surface to prevent moisture and dirt buildup." }
